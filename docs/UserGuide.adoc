== Introduction

My Team Manager (MTM) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, MTM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MTM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias that you can use to execute the command e.g to add player to address book, you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Have you entered a wrong command or might have accidentally entered the wrong values to the specified fields to a command? +

You don't have to worry, as MTM provides you with the command to undo most mistakes that you might have made. MTM will restore herself to the state before the previous _undoAble_ command was executed.

_undoAble_ commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).

[TIP]
.*Outcome*
====
Commands that are _undoAble_ will be reversed and MTM will be in the state before the command was executed.
====

Here are a few valid examples on how you can use the `undo` command:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
Calling the `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command.

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no _undoAble_ commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` +
`undo` +
Calling the first `undo` command will reverse the `clear` command, and the subsequent `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command.

Format: `redo` +
Alias: `r`

[TIP]
.*Outcome*
====
Previously executed `undo` command will be reversed and MTM will be in its previous state.
====

Here are a few valid examples on how you can use the `redo` command:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` +
`redo` +
Calling the `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command and the subsequent `redo` command will reapply the `delete 1` command.

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` +
`undo` +
`redo` +
`redo` +
Calling the first `undo` command will reverse the `clear` command, and the subsequent `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command. +
Calling the first `redo` command will reapply the `delete 1` command, and the subsequent `redo` command will reapply the `clear` command.
