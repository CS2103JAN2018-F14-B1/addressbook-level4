== Features

.*Getting started with Commands*
****

====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
** An example in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Fields that are in enclosed with `[ ]` are optional.
** An example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, can be used as, `n/John Doe t/friend`, or as, `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
** In this example, `[t/TAG]...`, these parameters are valid, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, and even `{nbsp}` (no parameter).
* Parameters can be entered in any order.
** For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====
****

.*The Use of Alias*
****

====
* Some commands have an alias that you can use to execute the command. This alias acts as a shortcut to execute the commands you want without typing the full command out.
** For example, you can type the alias `a` instead of the `add` command word to add a player into MTM.

=== Basic Commands and Features

Let's start of with the basic commands that MTM provides that gives you the power to effectively use MTM quickly. These features will make you use MTM more efficiently and teaches you how to navigate through MTM with ease.

To view the parameters for a command, press tab after the whole command is typed in. Pressing tab again will remove the parameters.

[TIP]
You can use the autocompleted parameters as a template after viewing them.

Text will turn red if the input has no parameters or if no matching command exists.

If there are multiple possible commands for a given input, i.e. 'e' could be 'edit' or 'exit',
then a dropdown box will appear with the possible commands. These can be navigated using mouse or arrow keys. Press enter to select the desired command.
