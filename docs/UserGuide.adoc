== Introduction

My Team Manager (MTM) is for *football team managers* who prefer to conduct management of their teams on their computers.
This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application where you, as a team manager, will be able to enter and organise details
of the players you are managing. The players will be organised into their respective teams, and you can include details such
as their positions and demerits, so that you can easily pick the lineup for matches. +
Head to <<Quick Start>> to get started with My Team Manager!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias that you can use to execute the command e.g to add player to address book, you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Autocomplete

After typing in the first few characters of a command, pressing kbd:[tab] will fill in the rest of the item. Since v1.1

To see parameters for a command, press tab after the whole command is typed in. Pressing tab again will remove the parameters. Since v1.2

Text will turn red if the input has no parameters or if no matching command exists.

If there are multiple possible commands for a given input, i.e. 'e' could be 'edit', 'exit', or 'export', then a dropdown box will appear with the possible commands. These can be navigated using mouse or arrow keys. Then, press enter to select the desired command. Since v1.2

Calling the `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command.

====
Previously executed `undo` command will be reversed and MTM will be in its previous state.
====

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +

`redo` +
Calling the first `undo` command will reverse the `clear` command, and the subsequent `undo` command will reverse the `delete 1` command. +

of a specific player easily by giving the player a remark for you to remember by.

Format: `remark INDEX [r/REMARK]` +
Alias: `rm`
