==== Justification

* Having tab - autocomplete makes entering commands much quicker. Futhermore, in case they forget, users can use the tab
 autocomplete to view suggested commands and command parameters.

* The new player object replaces the person object with more attributes to hold more information for the target user,
team managers, with added gui.
