== PROJECT: My Team Manager (MTM)

---

== Overview

My Team Manager (MTM) is a dekstop command-line interface (CLI) based address book application for football team managers.
It is a one-stop solution to help you manage your playerâ€™s contact details and team information in an efficient and convenient manner.
MTM is further enhanced with usability implementations that make MTM efficient and easy to use with JavaFX GUI display.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *team implementation and commands*.
** *What it does*: allows the user to perform *team management* functions such as creating, removing, renaming, viewing a team, and assigning players into a team.
** *Justification*: This feature is a core component to the product as it gives users the capability to manage and view their teams *easily and in a convenient way*.
** *Highlights*: The implementation requires new classes and commands to be created and also affects current existing `add` command. The class is set up so that future enhancements can use the data quickly. The implementation was challenging as it requires that player's information are in-sync with the information in the class.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a remark command that allows the user to leave a remark to a specific player. [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F14-B1/main/pull/58[PR#58]]
